# CLI-Calculator

##This is a professional calculator written in C# and with command-line-interface

###Description

* This calculator takes ***infinie*** inputs of numbers and operators 

* It takes **any** inputs and if inputs were not proper, it will error you

* It will **ignore** whitespaces in inputs 

***CLI-Calculator*** supports four main operators **( + , - , * , / )** for now

Anyway it's a good practice to get more **PROFESSIONAL**
